# 📚 Fine-Tuning LLM (03 Aug 2025)

## Fine-Tuning Large Language Models (LLMs): A Complete Step-by-Step Guide

Fine-tuning a Large Language Model (LLM) is one of the most powerful ways to adapt an existing AI model to your unique business or research needs.\
It allows you to inject domain-specific knowledge, change tone and personality, and optimize for specific tasks — all without building a model from scratch.

\
We’ll also highlight **why dataset creation is the most crucial step** and how using a larger LLM to filter your training data can drastically improve performance.

***

### 1. Understand Fine-Tuning & Choose the Right Method

Before you start, define your **vision** and **objectives**:

* Do you need a general assistant or a task-specific expert?
* Should it focus on tone, accuracy, or covering rare edge cases?

Fine-tuning methods:

* **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**\
  Updates small trainable matrices instead of all model weights.\
  Cost- and time-efficient — perfect for quick adaptation.
* **QLoRA**\
  Combines LoRA with **4-bit quantization** for memory savings.\
  Great for training large models on modest hardware (even a MacBook).
* **Full Fine-Tuning (FFT)**\
  Updates **all** model weights for maximum flexibility, but requires huge compute and memory.\
  Risk: _Catastrophic forgetting_ (losing performance on general tasks).
* **PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning)**\
  A category including LoRA — only updates a small subset of parameters, “freezing” the rest.

**Beginner tip:** Start with a small **instruct model** (e.g., Llama 3.1 8B) for faster, more data-efficient training.

### 2. Prepare a High-Quality Dataset — **The Most Crucial Step**

💡 **Your dataset dictates exactly how your model thinks, behaves, and what knowledge it gains.**

A small, well-curated dataset can outperform a large, noisy one.\
The most effective approach is to **use a larger LLM** to filter, score, and clean your training examples — so the smaller model learns only **high-quality, contextual data**.

Best practices:

* Structure as **question-answer (QA) pairs** or chat-style conversations.
* Generate synthetic data from **PDFs, videos, or existing logs**.
* Filter for accuracy, style, and relevance using a stronger LLM.
* Remove unnecessary “context” if it reduces clarity.
* Split into **training**, **validation**, and **test** sets.

The effort you put here will directly determine the final model’s performance.

***

### 3. Set Up Your Training Environment

You’ll need:

* **GPU access** (e.g., RunPod with 25GB VRAM).
* Copy your dataset to the training environment.

***

### 4. Data Loading & Formatting

Once the environment is ready:

* **Load dataset** (e.g., `load_dataset` from Hugging Face).
* **Apply chat templates** (system, user, assistant roles).
* **Tokenize** text into numerical tokens using the model’s tokenizer.
* **Batch** data efficiently based on GPU memory.

***

### 5. The Fine-Tuning Process

Steps for training:

* **Load base model** (e.g., Llama 3.1 8B).
* **Quantize** (QLoRA → 4-bit) to save memory.
* Enable **gradient checkpointing** and k-bit training optimizations.
* Define **LoRA Config**:
  * `rank` — size of adapter matrices (higher = better performance, more compute).
  * `lora_alpha` — scaling factor (often > rank).
  * `lora_dropout` — regularization.
  * `target_modules` — which layers to adapt.
* Use **SFTTrainer** with:
  * `num_train_epochs` — start low (1–3), increase for more learning.
  * `learning_rate` — lower values for precise adaptation.
  * `save_steps` — control checkpoint frequency.
* Start training and **monitor loss** (≈0.55 is healthy) & token accuracy (>0.9 ideal).

***

### 6. Evaluation & Iteration

Evaluate in two ways:

* **Manual** — Chat with the model to check style, accuracy, and domain knowledge.
* **Automated** — Use tools like _lm-evaluation-harness_ or SuperAnnotate.

If results are weak:

* Improve data quality.
* Adjust LoRA parameters.
* Train for more epochs.

***

### 7. Save & Deploy

* Save **LoRA adapter files** (≈100MB).
* **Deploy locally** (Ollama, text-generation-webui) or push to Hugging Face Hub.
* For inference:
  * Use `ollama run <model_name>` or
  * `FastLanguageModel.for_inference()` with `max_new_tokens` for control.

***

### 8. Advanced Tips for Maximum Performance

* Increase **LoRA rank & alpha** (e.g., rank 256, alpha 512).
* Train for **more epochs** (e.g., 100–500) if data is clean.
* Use **larger LLMs for filtering** — dramatically improves results for smaller models.

✅ **Key Takeaway:**\
Fine-tuning isn’t just about running a training script — it’s about **strategic dataset creation**, **smart parameter choices**, and **iterative refinement**.\
Your model is only as good as the data you feed it.
